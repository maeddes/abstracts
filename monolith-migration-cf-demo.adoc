== Live Migration of a JavaEE Monolith to different cloud platforms

The intention of this talk is to show a live step-by-step approach to migrate a monolithic WebSphere application to various cloud-native platforms like Docker&Kubernetes and Cloud Foundry. It starts showing the application running in itâ€™s WebSphere environments and finishes running the migrated app on Cloud Foundry. On the migration journey the following steps are shown:

* Deployment and runtime on WebSphere
* Analysis of application in terms of required code changes and connected backend services
* Configuration and bring up of the application on WebSphere Liberty Profile
* Deployment and runtime on PCF Dev using Community Buildpack for Liberty
* Migration of backend services to Cloud Platform (Microsoft Azure in this example)
* Deployment and runtime of application on PCF on Azure
* Application of strangler pattern to start slicing the monolith into Microservices.

It is based on a talk given at the User track of Cloud Foundry Summit in Basel 2018. It was received very well, got a lot of good feedback and brought up interesting discussions with the attendees. While this talk was very conceptual, this new version is intended to demonstrate the involved steps in a live example and perform the migration within the given time of 30 minutes.
