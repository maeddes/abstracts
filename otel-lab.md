In today's modern software landscape - in the cloud-native one in particular - observability has become a critical aspect of ensuring the performance, reliability, and security of applications. OpenTelemetry, a standard and open-source observability framework, provides a unified way to collect and export telemetry data from applications and services. This hands-on lab will guide participants through the process of using OpenTelemetry to instrument a simple application, collect metrics, traces, and logs, and send them to various backends for analysis.

The lab covers the implementation and usage of OpenTelemetry into Python and Java-based applications. Each participant will get a dedicated environment.



The exercises include



the instrumentation of a polyglot microservice application
auto-instrumentation vs. manual instrumentation
evaluating the collected traces, logs and metrics
configuring a collector
analysing the results in Jaeger


This lab is made for developers seeking a pragmatic understanding of OpenTelemetry's immediate benefits. Walk away with practical skills that can be implemented right away in your projects, and elevate your observability game in just 180 minutes.

In the last 2 years, OpenTelemetry has emerged as one of the most crucial CNCF projects, playing a pivotal role in contemporary cloud-native observability strategies. This open-source framework provides a unified approach to collecting and exporting telemetry data, ensuring developers have a robust toolset to enhance application performance and reliability. Join our hands-on lab to explore the practical implementation of OpenTelemetry in just 180 minutes, gaining skills that directly impact your projects.

The user's will either need to have a local docker installation or can directly use clod-based technologies like GitHub Codespaces or GitPod. An account with GitHub or GitLab is necessary to access this.

A basic understanding of either Java or Python and command-line familiarity is recommended, but not necessary.
