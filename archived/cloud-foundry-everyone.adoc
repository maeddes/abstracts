This talk will give an overview of the various possibilities to easily access and get in touch with the Cloud Foundry platform. Cloud Foundry comes in various flavors, there is a big range of commercial hosted offerings, private deployment options and various development environment alternatives. This presentation is intended for users who would like to get their first hands-on experience or for others who might want to evaluate an alternative deployment option. The analysis will compare the public offerings based on the metrics of price, availability, options and available services as well as the self-deployed options in terms of simplicity in setup and handling and requirements. It is supposed to cover the breadth of the Cloud Foundry offerings and give an easy entry path to the technology. Kubernetes-based offerings like CFCR, containerized CF and Project Eirini will be covered as well.

This talk intends to increase the Cloud Foundry community by showing easy paths to get started and becoming familiar with it.
It also helps existing users to evaluate different Cloud Foundry provider options depending on different aspects like price, availability, options and available services.
It can be seen as a state of the art survey of free Cloud Foundry options given by various (certified) providers and local development options.
This talk has already been given in CF Summit North America 2019 and on meetups. It got a very good feedback from the community.
