Howto: From source code to container runtime

short:
The broad adoption of container technology mostly driven by the rise of Docker and Kubernetes has changed the skill expectation towards developers. It is not only required any more to be knowledgeable about the programming language, framework and respective build process. The steps of how to containerize it and deploy it also has become a standard. This talk will show various options to do so.

long:
A typical workflow in a modern software dev project can look like:
Build code, put built artifact into container image, put container image into registry, deploy to Kubernetes. Each step has it's own requirements and pitfalls alike. The overall goal is most often to bake those steps into easily repeatable pipelines and enable a high degree of automation.

Dockerfiles seems to be option with the highest adoption when it comes to containerizing code artifacts. However there are options, which might remove some of the pitfalls and standardize the entire process even more.

The talk will give deeper insights by comparing (multi-stage) Dockerfiles to Cloud-Native Buildpacks (buildpacks.io/paketo.io) and Google's JIB under the evaluation criteria of build time, build size, standardization, robustness and security.
The examples and live demo will have certain focus on Java-based frameworks (Spring Boot, Quarkus, Java EE), but coverage of other languages will also be included and highlighted.

The intented take-away of the session is a better overview of container building and deployment options along with understanding of requirements, advantages and drawbacks.
