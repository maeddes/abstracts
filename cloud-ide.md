Titles:

* A) Is this the year of the development environment in the cloud?
* B) Codespaces, Gitpod, Devpod ... what cloud and container-based IDEs can do for you

###

Over the last 2 years cloud-based integrated development environments (IDEs) such as Gitpod or GitHub Codespaces have gained a lot of popularity. Devpod is the most recent Open Source technology in this field and there will very likely be more additions in the near future.

With this talk I compare and contrast the features of these technologies opposed to traditional ones and highlight how container technology serves as the base technology to make this happen.
This includes the devcontainer specification.

Furthermore, I will explore the advances made in this field and discuss the limitations that still exist.

I will demonstrate the ease and efficiency for developing polyglot, container-based distributed applications.
The live demo will show how a developer can start coding away in seconds without the need to set up any build environment for a magnitude of predefined programming languages and frameworks.
This includes immediate showcasing of the development results, testing ability and deployment to external Kubernetes environments.

Additionally, I will demonstrate how custom additions can be made if something is still missing.
This highlights how advanced this field has become in recent years and where there is still room for improvement.

Moreover, I will discuss how cloud IDEs have helped me in teaching distributed systems at university, by ensuring that all my students have a consistent development setup.
This will also showcase how these environments can be used to standardize development environments in team projects, making the development process more efficient and streamlined.

Codespaces, Gitpod, Devpod ... what cloud and container-based IDEs can do for you

In den letzten 2 Jahren haben cloud-basierte Entwicklungsumgebungen wie Gitpod oder GitHub Codespaces stark an Popularität gewonnen. Mit Devpod kam vor kurzem eine neue Open Source Technologie in diesem Feld dazu und es ist sehr wahrscheinlich, daß es in naher Zukunft noch weitere Neuerscheinungen geben wird.

Mit diesem Vortrag vergleiche ich den Ansatz dieser Technologien im Vergleich zu traditionellen IDEs und versuche die Rolle der Container Technologie - insbesonders der devcontainer Spezifikation - zu beleuchten.

Der Fokus liegt hier auf der JVM-basierten Sprachen und den IDEs VisualStudio Code und IntelliJ.

Ich werde in einer Live Demo zeigen wie schnell es möglich ist ohne großes Setup polyglotte, container-basierte Anwendungen zu entwickeln. Das beinhaltet auch die Möglichkeit die Development und Test Ergebnisse sofort zu zeigen, sowie das Deployment in Umgebungen außerhalb der IDEs.

In der Demo zeige ich auch wie man das Standard Setup für die eigenen Bedürfnisse anpassen kann.

Ich werde auch darauf eingehen wie mir die Technologien bei den praktischen Beispielen in verschieden Szenarien vom beruflichen Alltag wie auch bei der Vorlesung an den Hochschulen geholfen hat.
